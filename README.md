# {helpai} : Simplified help pages in R thanks to AI

The {helpai} package is currently under development. The main functions are being migrated from various packages used for the initial developments.

The functions [ai_ask(), ai_explain_term(), ai_explain_function(), ai_explain_code(), and ai_explain_error()](https://www.sciviews.org/SciViews/reference/ai_ask.html) are currently available in the SciViews GitHub repository.

An RStudio add-in that uses the functions mentioned above is currently available in the [BioDataScience](https://github.com/BioDataScience-Course/BioDataScience) repository.
